# Module-21-

Overview: FOr this repository, My h5 files are located inside the folder in the main branch called module-21 along with the ipynb file which contain the model it self. Resources I used were Instructor Drew's speed runs and the recorded class sessions. For further understanding and structure design, I used stacks overflow to help me write code and assist on debugging processes.
